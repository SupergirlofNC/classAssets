# About This Respository
This repository is a storage and retreival space for assets for class projects and tutorials. Material is not suited for general use, as each is situationally specific to the learning environment it was created for. 
These resources are intended for students and participants in my courses, workshops, and tutorials. If you would like to use these assets for production or resource, I ask that you humbley reach out and contact me for permission before any such use.
